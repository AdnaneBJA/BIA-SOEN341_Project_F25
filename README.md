<h1>README</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2><br>
Implementing a campus event ticketing web application.

<h2>Description</h2><br>
This website is a Campus Event and Ticketing Application meant for students to discover, organize and attend the events available on their campus.

The website is available to students, administrators and organizers. Students have the option to discover events and manage their events. To discover events, students can browse using filters such as the event date, category and organization. For the management of their events, they can save events to their calendar, claim tickets or receive a digital ticket using a unique QR code.

The organizers can create events by entering the details. They can also view the analytics of an event on a dashboard that show the stats. The organizers can also use tools to export the list of attendees of an event in CSV and they can scan tickets for validation. 

The administrators have the option to oversee the platform where they can approve organizer accounts and moderate the event listings. The administrators can manage organizations and assign roles and they can also view stats of the website.

The additional feature will be a flexible pricing option for last minute ticket discounts.
